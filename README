Project: Easy Rider

This is code for the final project in the Fall 2011 Information Visualization
cource offered by Kent State University. The class was led by Dr. Ye Zhao. The
students involved on this project are:
    James Baiera,

The project centers around a visualization of elevation and traffic data onto
a Google Map inside a simple webpage.
